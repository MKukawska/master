# This repository is a portfolio of my programming projects.

Content:
  - CIFAR10_classification.ipynb - a classification algorithm built for CIFAR 10 dataset with using Inception-v3 embedding
  
  - genetic_algorithm.py - my implementation of genetic algorithm, which was prepared for TensorCell project. This is an early version. In the future it will be generalized more and rewriten to object oriented code.
  
  - cars_type_recognition.py - a simple convolutional neural network in Keras for cars type recognition on Stanford Cars 196 dataset. My university project.
  
  - highway_traffic_simulation.jl - an autonomus agents simulation of three-line highway traffic based on Nagel Schreck model. My university project.
  
  - Looking_for_relationships.ipynb - data manipulations with Pandas and simple feature selection for logistic regression.
